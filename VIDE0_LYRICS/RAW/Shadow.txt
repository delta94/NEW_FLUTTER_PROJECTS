BRADLEY COOPER:
Tell me something girl…
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there something else you’re searching for?

I’m falling
In all the good times I find myself along and for change
And in the bad times I feel myself

LADY GAGA:
Tell me something boy…
Aren’t you tired trying fill that void
Or do you need more?
Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore

I’m falling
In all the good times I find myself along and for change
And in the bad times I feel myself

I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I’ll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
We’re far from the shallow now

BOTH:
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We’re far from the shallow now

LADY GAGA:
Wooaaaah
Woaaaaaaaaaaah

I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I’ll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
We’re far from the shallow now

BOTH:
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We’re far from the shallow now
