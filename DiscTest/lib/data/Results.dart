    'According to Integrity Works Coaching, 10-15% of the population identifies with this personality type.',
    'Although “D” type people are direct and straightforward, they are not necessarily hasty. They think things through and do not dive head-in so that later, they can have regrets. A “D” personality will take responsibility for their action, as they have taken the best possible course of action. Other traits include: assertive, dynamic and efficient. Such an individual will not lose time to get to the bottom line. Highly motivated, ambitious and bright, this person will play detective as long as it takes in order to solve the problem!',
    'If competing with a “D” person, be prepared for a hell of a race! Dominant people enjoy challenges and will most certainly rise to the occasion! That means they are goal-oriented and aim high; at the same time, they are very resourceful and adaptive, so they have a reputation of being formidable opponents.',
    'Word of advice: never deprive a “D” personality type of their recognition or admiration! “D” people seek appreciation for the effort they invest in their work, both professionally and personally.',
    'Like everybody else, they have less pretty traits, too. Being in the spotlight is something they like a lot but unfortunately, they are capable of ruffling other people’s feathers to get there. If in charge, they can be very critical, reason why employees see them as bossy and overwhelming. I previously mentioned that they make good detectives…as a downside, they tend to pick on any small detail that doesn’t fit the global picture, so you should triple-check everything before handing it in!',
    'Are you wondering what’s the best way of relating with a  “D” personality type?  Well, here are some pointers:',
    '1. Cut straight to the point! There’s no need for one-hour introduction! \n 2. Respect their need for autonomy \n 3. Clarify with them what the rules and expectation are \n 4. Show that you are self-sufficient and competent \n 5. Let them charge; they like it!',
    'Because I wouldn’t want you wasting your time wishful-thinking, here’s what TO expect from a dominant type person:',
    '1. They are excruciatingly blunt \n 2. Demanding \n 3. No empathy \n 4. No sympathy \n 5. You won’t get much social interaction'

    'According to Integrity Works Coaching, 25-30% of the population identifies with this personality type.',
    'In through the door comes Influence…  And as it’s name suggests, it actually does influence other people! People who identify with this typology are bubbly, energetic beings who light up the room when they come in. They inspire, energize and like doing activities that involve a lot of people. They are, by default, the best entertainers. At the same time though, the spotlight can get to their heads, so if you’re looking to befriend an “I”, then you must remember this.',
    'When I’m down, I call my “I” person. Why? I’ll give you 5 reasons:'
        '1. They genuinely like being around people; \n 2. They are open and emotionally honest, so that makestheir advice one you can count on; \n 3. By being optimistic, they manage to lift your spirits; \n 4. It’s like they were bornto give motivational speeches, that’s how good they are!; \n 5. The reason why I have my “I” friend on speed dial – they have the best jokes! Remember that an Inspirer is typically renowned for his/her sense of humor!',
    'On the less brighter side, such individuals may take things quite personally, because they have a bit too much concern for other people’s feelings. This can also make them want to withdraw in their own little corner if they feel rejected.',
    'Remember when I said that “I’s” make friends quickly? Well, the downside is that these relationships can many times be superficial, so don’t go off thinking you’ve found your soulmate just yet!',
    'Want tips for relating with an “I” personality type? Well, here they are:',
    '1. Don’t address them with sir/madam or any other formal approaches \n 2. Relax and try to act friendly \n 3. Encourage them to express their thoughts and feelings \n 4. Keep the conversation light \n 5. Give written details (you know how forgetful they can be when caught up in the moment!)',
    'What you should expect from an Influencer:',
    '1. Constant, yet unintentional attempts to persuade you of things \n 2. need to be in the center of attention \n 3. Idealized images of themselves and of the people around them \n 4. Vulnerability to perceived rejection \n 5. real team spirit'

    'Do you know those memes-  “Keep calm and carry on”, “Keep calm and chase your dreams”, Keep calm and grow a mustache” ,etc, etc? Yeah…the whole “keep calm” thing must have been invented by an “S” person! They’re the only ones who can actually be that calm! And can you believe that 30-35% of the population is like that?',
    'The Supportive or Stable kind, is, just as its name suggests, down-to-earth, relaxed and composed. You won’t get emotions spiking out of this character! So, if you’re looking for someone who is balanced, safe and reliable, look no further! People who have this personality type are very supportive when it comes to their friends’ needs. They will be the first ones willing to help, even if it puts them in a somewhat tight spot.',
    '“S” people are usually regarded as good employees because they are able to do routine work with care and patience. Furthermore, they are good at multi-tasking and meeting deadlines. At the same time, though, they can easily get lost in their desire to help others and therefore, lose sight of what’s important.',
    'When taken out of their comfort zone, “S” people react badly. So give them time to adjust to change. Connected to this is another attribute- passivity. Because such individuals wish to avoid conflicts, they don’t face the situation head on and so, end up experiencing frustration and resentment. These people can hold a grudge, especially if they see you taking credit for their hard work!',
    'Next, we have some tips on how to build a good relationship with a Steady person:',
    '1. Be clear and offer specifics; don’t digress! \n 2. Recognize their loyalty and service \n 3. No sudden movements \n 4. No pressure \n 5. Show openness instead of coming off as aggressive or competitive',
    'What kind of behaviour should you foresee? Well…',
    '1. Keeping calm and carrying on… \n 2. A real team player \n 3. Friendly with colleagues and supervisors \n 4. Difficulty in prioritizing \n 5. Highly resistant to change'

    'The only people who can make sense out of the image below are the Cautious personality type also known as The Analyzers. And then they’ll tell you the result isn’t accurate.',
    'In general, “C” people can offer precise details about almost anything. They like to follow rules, both in their professional and personal life. And that’s a good thing because it brings them stability, an aspect they treasure. Because of the fact that they are analytical and systematical, they are really good problem solvers! When focused on solving a task, they get very creative because they see details other people miss.',
    'Such individuals are usually peaceful and adaptable. They assess new situations objectively and approach them with tact. As a result, they minimize risks. Don’t expect to go bungee jumping…on the spot, with someone who fits a “C” personality type! They won’t take that chance!',
    'Conscientious people like being dealt with in a reserved, formal manner. For them, it’s a matter of respect and recognition. As managers, they have an “all-hands-on-deck” attitude that gets the job done and has the wow effect. Because they like being right, they spend time researching every aspect of a situation. That leads to very high standards for themselves and for the people around them.',
    'Like the “S” personality type, this one is also adverse to change. It will prefer sticking to methods that have proved successful in the past, instead of trying something new. The difference here is how they react to confrontational situations. “S” people give in and comply with expectations, while “C’s” do anything in their power to avoid it.',
    'Ok. But how to get along with a “Thinker”?',
    '1. Do not criticize \n 2. Offer precise information \n 3. Respect their need to be alone \n 4. They are instinctive organizers, so… let them organize \n 5. Do not generalize; it’s very offensive',
    'Be able to recognize these types of behaviour in a “C” person!',
    '1. Calmness \n 2. Need to double- or triple- check \n 3. Saying it like it is (they are, in fact, the reality anchor of the group) \n 4. Difficulty in expressing feelings \n 5. Little social interaction'
